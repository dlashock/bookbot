# bookbot
Boot.dev Python Project #1
BookBot is my first project!

This project prompts the end user for a number between 1-4, the number of books available for the program to evaluate. Based on the input from the user the program outputs the number of words and number of times each character is present in the text, in descending order.

If I feel up to it I may increase the capabilities of this program. A few ideas I have are:

1) Allow users to direct the application to their own text
2) Output the number of times the top 10 words are present in the text
3) Allow users to choose what report they want to see, prompting them until they want to exit
